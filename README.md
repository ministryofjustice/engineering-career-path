_A work in progress_

## Engineering Career Pathway

The [@ministryofjustice/software-development-leaders](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/software-development-leaders/members) team are using this repo to produce a career pathway for people in our profession. We have the DDaT Capability Framework at the moment. Here are the two roles that comprise the development profession:

- [Software Developer Role Description](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/software-developer-role-description/software-developer-role-description)
- [Development Operations Role Description](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/development-operations-role-description/development-operations-role-description) (MoJ D&T refer to this role as WebOps)


We aim to build on this to:

- show how people can advance their way through our profession in MoJ Digital and Technology
- give direction about how someone can improve in their profession or role
- surface how people are doing against MoJ Digital and Technology's needs

## What we're working on now

To get this off the ground, the software development leadership team will meet to work on the foundations of the pathway, e.g. style of pathway, categories, level of detail, local agency needs vs profession needs, etc...

## How to contribute

We need and want your contributions. We plan to make regular requests for comment using GitHub Issues. It's really important for us to get a diverse range of input; from people new to the organisation and people who've been around for a while, from junior through to senior level, from professions outside of our own.

As we make progress, please contribute your thoughts and opinions when asked.
